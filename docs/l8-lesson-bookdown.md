# Lesson n°8



## Energy assimilations

... In English, EA:

* is frequent in unstressed contexts: *"it was spectacular*", "*of course*", "*if she chooses to wait*", "*the waiter's forgotten us*"...

* only goes from lenis to fortis, never the other way round ("*back door*" or "*not bad*")

* is rare in stressed syllables, *cf*:
  - "*have to*", "*used to*", where EA has now become compulsory.

- word-internal EAs with free variations: "*absurd*", "*obsession*", "*absorb*"...




\begin{longtable}{lll}
\toprule
Word & Stress & Received Pronunciation\\
\midrule
\cellcolor{gray!6}{absorb} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/01/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{@b."sO:b}/}\\
obsession & /010/ & /\textipa{@b."seS.@n}/\\
\cellcolor{gray!6}{absurd} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/01/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{@b."s3:d}/}\\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}



 
Energy assimilation is also the process which explains the pronunciation of certain infamous morphosyntactic suffixes...






#### Morphosyntactic suffixes

##### <-(e)d>

Explain the pronunciations of:

* "tagged", "tacked", "buzzed", "cursed", "played", "chafed", "loved". 


\begin{longtable}{lll}
\toprule
Word & Stress & Received Pronunciation\\
\midrule
\cellcolor{gray!6}{tagged} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/1/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{t\ae gd}/}\\
tacked & /1/ & /\textipa{t\ae kt}/\\
\cellcolor{gray!6}{buzzed} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/1/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{b2zd}/}\\
cursed & /1/ & /\textipa{k3:st}/\\
\cellcolor{gray!6}{played} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/2/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{""pleId}/}\\
\addlinespace
chafed & /1/ & /\textipa{tSeIft}/\\
\cellcolor{gray!6}{loved} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/1/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{l2vd}/}\\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Can the suffix be pronounced differently? How and where?



##### <-(e)s>

Explain the pronunciations of:

* "shoves", "freckles", "books", "shrimps", "bags", "stubs", "whiffs"


\begin{longtable}{lll}
\toprule
Word & Stress & Received Pronunciation\\
\midrule
\cellcolor{gray!6}{shoves} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/1/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{S2vz}/}\\
freckles & /10/ & /\textipa{"frek.@lz}/\\
\cellcolor{gray!6}{books} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/1/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{bUks}/}\\
shrimps & /1/ & /\textipa{SrImps}/\\
\cellcolor{gray!6}{bags} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/1/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{b\ae gz}/}\\
\addlinespace
stubs & /1/ & /\textipa{st2bz}/\\
\cellcolor{gray!6}{whiffs} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/1/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{wIfs}/}\\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Can the suffix be pronounced differently? How and where?



### Elision

Sometimes in connected speech, phonemes are elided, *i.e.* deleted, to make articulation easier.

Examples: "tasteless", "mind-bogling"



Historically, elision is a very common phenomenon: 

* "cupboard", "talk", "comb", "gnome", "whistle"...


\begin{longtable}{lll}
\toprule
Word & Stress & Received Pronunciation\\
\midrule
\cellcolor{gray!6}{cupboard} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/10/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{"k2b.@d}/}\\
talk & /1/ & /\textipa{tO:k}/\\
\cellcolor{gray!6}{comb} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/1/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{k@Um}/}\\
gnome & /1/ & /\textipa{n@Um}/\\
\cellcolor{gray!6}{whistle} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/10/} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{"wIs.@l}/}\\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}



### Liaison

The converse of elision is liaison.

Regardless of the rhoticity of a given accent of English, a **linking /r/** is often added as a link across word boundaries (also called *sandhi r*).



* "sooner" vs. "sooner or later"

* "sure" vs. "sure enough"

* "the sofa in the catalogue"

* "my idea of heaven"

* "we saw a film"

* "via Australia"


\begin{longtable}{lll}
\toprule
Word & Stress & Received Pronunciation\\
\midrule
\cellcolor{gray!6}{sure enough} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{//} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{SO:} \textipa{I."n2f}/}\\
the sofa in the catalogue & // & /\textipa{Di:} \textipa{"s@Uf.@} \textipa{In} \textipa{Di:} \textipa{"k\ae t.@.l6g}/\\
\cellcolor{gray!6}{my idea of heaven} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{//} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{maI} \textipa{aI."dI@} \textipa{6v} \textipa{"hev.@n}/}\\
we saw a film & // & /\textipa{wi:} \textipa{sO:} \textipa{eI} \textipa{fIlm}/\\
\cellcolor{gray!6}{via Australia} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{//} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{/\textipa{"vaI.@} \textipa{6."streIl.i.@}/}\\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}
