## /\textipa{\ae }/ in American

We follow @labov2010.

Images are from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inland_Northern_American_English)




### An example of sound changes: the NCS

The Northern Cities Shift is a rotation of short vowels taking place
in the Inland North, a territory comprising 34 million speakers.

The Northern Cities Shift\end{center}

 


Assumed order of the rotation:

1. General raising and fronting of /\textipa{\ae }/ ("bat")

1. Fronting of /\textipa{6}/ ("got")

1. Lowering of /\textipa{O:}/ ("bought")

1. Backward shift of /\textipa{e}/ ("bet") towards /\textipa{2}/

1. Backing and rounding of /\textipa{2}/

1. Backing of /\textipa{I}/ ("bit")



> This rotation of short vowels is a remarkable development, given the relative stability of the English short vowel system from old English up to the twentieth century (p.112).

--

> No other dialect shows such a generalized tensing and raising (p.113).





 

### Let's focus on /\textipa{\ae }/

> While *a* is raised and fronted in particular context by almost all speakers of North American English, a historical process in this particular area  has eliminated all **contextual conditions** (p.114).
 
--

> All other dialects with short-*a* raising will differentiate prenasal vowels from others (p.113).
 



4 types of short-*a* systems originating from upstate New-York:

1. *The nasal system*: allophonic tensing of /\textipa{\ae }/ before nasal consonants, and nowhere else (New England)

1. *The nasal system with the broad-a pattern*: "aunt", "can't", "half", "past" (newer settlers)

1. *The split short-a system:* tensing in syllables closed by voiced stops, voiceless fricatives and front nasals — along with many grammatical and lexical specifications (*cf.* "mad", "bad", "glad" vs. "sad" and "dad" in Philadelphia).

1. *The Celtic substrate:* speakers of Hiberno-English, where short *a* is low front or low entral.

This of course leads to misunderstandings...



###  NCS-induced misunderstandings

The following examples show what non-NCS speakers understood.

* Correct the examples to what was actually meant.

* Say which step of the NCS these misunderstandings were caused by (1/2/3/4/5/6).

### Other misunderstandings

Can you formulate *why* the following misunderstandings happened, using phonetic concepts?

## Les catégories de voyelles

Essayez d'établir une typologie des 20 voyelles de la *RP*.



* checked steady-state vowels: /\textipa{I e \ae  6 U 2}/ & /\textipa{@}/ (!!)

* Free steady-state: /\textipa{i: a: O: u: 3:}/

* Diphthongs:
  - centring: /\textipa{I@ U@}/
  - closing:
    - Fronting: /\textipa{eI aI OI}/
    - Backing: /\textipa{@U aU}/

Il manque une voyelle... Laquelle ?



 /\textipa{E:}/, ou /\textipa{@e}/
